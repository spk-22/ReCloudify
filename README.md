# ReCloudify
ReCloudify enables users to repurpose old laptops as remote storage devices, creating a personal cloud. Using a client-server model with socket programming, data can be seamlessly stored and accessed over a network. This decentralized approach offers cost-effective, private, and expandable storage without relying on third-party cloud providers.
